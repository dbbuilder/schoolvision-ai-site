## Measurement of Success

The tagline succeeds when:
1. Prospects immediately understand we complement, not compete with SIS
2. "Complete" becomes associated with SchoolVision.AI in the market
3. Clients use it to describe their improved visibility
4. It differentiates us from point solutions

## Evolution Path

As the market matures, the tagline can evolve:
- Year 1: "Complete Campus Intelligence"
- Year 2: "Complete Campus Intelligence. Guaranteed."
- Year 3: "The Standard for Complete Campus Intelligence"

## Don'ts

Never:
- Shorten to just "Campus Intelligence" (loses differentiation)
- Add unnecessary words that dilute impact
- Use without context in technical documentation
- Translate literally to other languages without cultural adaptation

## Approval

All uses of the tagline in external communications should maintain these standards. When in doubt, the complete phrase "Complete Campus Intelligence" is always appropriate.
