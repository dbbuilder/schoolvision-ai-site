# SchoolVision.AI - Unified Messaging Framework

## Core Value Proposition

**SchoolVision.AI: Completing Your Campus Data Story**

Your Student Information System (SIS) captures academic records, but what about everything else that happens on campus? SchoolVision.AI integrates all the parts of campus life your SIS doesn't capture - from cafeteria transactions to lab equipment usage, from bus rides to bookstore purchases - creating a complete, AI-enhanced picture of your institution.

## Primary Messaging

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Student Success Prediction
**SIS Data**: Junior with 3.2 GPA
**SchoolVision.AI Data**: 
- Cafeteria visits decreased 40% this month
- Library usage down 60%
- Hasn't purchased required textbooks
- Missed last three bus rides to campus
**AI Insight**: 87% probability of dropping out - recommend immediate intervention

### Example 2: Department Resource Optimization
**SIS Data**: Chemistry enrollments up 15%
**SchoolVision.AI Data**:
- Lab supply usage up 45%
- Equipment checkout waitlists growing
- Safety incident reports increasing
- Student success rates declining
**AI Insight**: Under-resourced for enrollment - need 2 additional lab sections

### Example 3: Financial Aid Effectiveness
**SIS Data**: Student received $5,000 aid package
**SchoolVision.AI Data**:
- Bookstore charges: $1,200
- Meal plan usage: 60% (food insecurity risk)
- Transportation costs: $300/month
- Lab fees outstanding: $400
**AI Insight**: Aid package insufficient - student at financial risk
