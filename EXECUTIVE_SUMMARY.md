# SchoolVision.AI - Executive Summary

## Project Vision
Transform SchoolVision.net into SchoolVision.AI - the intelligent integration layer that captures all campus data your SIS doesn't, creating a complete picture of institutional operations with AI-enhanced analytics to understand the past, measure the present, and predict the future.

## Core Value Proposition
**"Complete Campus Intelligence Through Seamless Integration"**

SchoolVision.AI partners with your Student Information System to create a unified intelligence platform. Your SIS captures essential academic data - we integrate it with operational insights from every corner of campus, using AI to transform this complete picture into actionable intelligence that helps you understand the past, measure the present, and make informed predictions about the future.
