# SchoolVision.AI Marketing Site - Development TODO

## üî• MOST CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Before Production)

1. **Missing Critical Pages**: `/accessibility`, `/ferpa`, `/sitemap` pages are linked but don't exist
2. **Broken Links**: Footer has 10+ links pointing to "#" placeholder
3. **No Real Backend**: Forms use placeholder EmailJS, no actual submission
4. **All Content is Fake**: Testimonials, blog posts, resources are all hardcoded placeholders
5. **No Error Pages**: Missing 404 and error handling pages
6. **Security Headers**: No CSP, no cookie consent for GDPR
7. **Images**: All images are external Unsplash links (will break if Unsplash changes)
8. **No Analytics**: No tracking or conversion measurement
9. **Hardcoded Data**: Company stats, contact info hardcoded throughout
10. **No Search**: FAQ and site-wide search don't actually work
